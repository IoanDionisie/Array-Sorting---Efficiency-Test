# MySortingProgram

With this program, you can test the efficiency of different popular array sorting methods. It generates a random array, with a size 
specified by the user, and then you can choose one sorting method, or you can compare the times between two different sorting methods.

Also, it is possible to sort the array with all the sorting methods, and the output will specify which method was the most efficient. 


Enjoy!
